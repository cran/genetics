Version 1.0.1

- Fixed mislabeling of rows/columns in LDtable

- Extended LDtable to resize text to fit box area, and to allow
  selection of which statistics are displayed, and which statistic is
  used for coloration.

- Extended LDtable to allow all columns & rows to be shown

- Added a larger example to plot.LD.data.frame documentation

- Changed the name of some function parameters to be more clear and/or
  consistent

- Added summary.LD.data.frame and print.LD.data.frame

- Fixed a bug in genotype() when reorder="no", such as when called by
  haplotype().


Version 1.0.0

- New functions to estimate and test linkage disequilibrium (LD):
	LD, LD.genotype, LD.data.frame

- New functions to display LD results
	print.LD, print.LD.data.frame, plot.LD.data.frame, LDtable, LDplot

- Various bug-fixes and corrections


Version 0.6.8

- Added HWE.chisq which performs the Chi-Square test for
  Hardy-Wienberg Equilibrium.

- Modified HWE.exact to return an object of class 'htest'.

- Modified HWE.test to use HWE.exact by default for 2-allele
  genotypes, and HWE.chisq otherwise.


Version 0.6.7

- Added 'HWE.exact()', an exact test for Hardy-Wienberg Equilibrium for
  two alleles. Code contributed by David Duffy <davidD@qimr.edu.au>

- Added 'gregorius()', which computes the probability of observing all
  alleles with a given frequency in a sample of a specified size.
