Version 1.1.2
-------------

- Remove debugging code that printed intermediate values (sometimes
  a lot of them).

- Ensure that allele.freq table reported by summary.genotype has the
  same ordering as allele.names table.

Version 1.1.1
-------------

- Make it clear that the Yates continuty correction is applied
  *only* when simulate.p.value=FALSE, so that the reported test
  statistics for simulate.p.value=FALSE and simulate.p.value=TRUE
  will differ.

- Attempt to fix/clarify HWE diseq.  computations & synchronize
  documentation.

- Updated to use a namespace and to work with the lastest gregmisc
  bundle, which was previously a package.

Version 1.1.0
-------------

- Add namespace support

- R/diseq.R: Restore ability to show Observed vs. Expected table by
  adding "table" option for the 'show' parameter.

- Updates to power.casectrl.  (including renaming from power.casectl)

- Update to work with gregmisc now that it has been converted from a
  package to a bundle.

Version 1.0.4
-------------

- Updated to remove warnings in R CMD check for R 1.9.1.

Version 1.0.2
-------------

- Fixed Heterozygosity (H) and PIC calculations in summary.genotype.
  (Bug report from Gerard Tromp <gtromp@cmb.biosci.wayne.edu>.

- Added experimental, undocumented, and untested function hapmcmc for
  imputing haplotypes and related functions. (Code submitted by David
  Duffy <davidD@qimr.edu.au>).


Version 1.0.1
-------------

- Fixed mislabeling of rows/columns in LDtable

- Extended LDtable to resize text to fit box area, and to allow
  selection of which statistics are displayed, and which statistic is
  used for coloration.

- Extended LDtable to allow all columns & rows to be shown

- Added a larger example to plot.LD.data.frame documentation

- Changed the name of some function parameters to be more clear and/or
  consistent

- Added summary.LD.data.frame and print.LD.data.frame

- Fixed a bug in genotype() when reorder="no", such as when called by
  haplotype().


Version 1.0.0
-------------

- New functions to estimate and test linkage disequilibrium (LD):
	LD, LD.genotype, LD.data.frame

- New functions to display LD results
	print.LD, print.LD.data.frame, plot.LD.data.frame, LDtable, LDplot

- Various bug-fixes and corrections


Version 0.6.8
-------------

- Added HWE.chisq which performs the Chi-Square test for
  Hardy-Wienberg Equilibrium.

- Modified HWE.exact to return an object of class 'htest'.

- Modified HWE.test to use HWE.exact by default for 2-allele
  genotypes, and HWE.chisq otherwise.


Version 0.6.7
-------------

- Added 'HWE.exact()', an exact test for Hardy-Wienberg Equilibrium for
  two alleles. Code contributed by David Duffy <davidD@qimr.edu.au>

- Added 'gregorius()', which computes the probability of observing all
  alleles with a given frequency in a sample of a specified size.
