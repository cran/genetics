Changes since version 0.6.7

- Added HWE.chisq which performs the Chi-Square test for
  Hardy-Wienberg Equilibrium.

- Modified HWE.exact to return an object of class 'htest'.

- Modified HWE.test to use HWE.exact by default for 2-allele
  genotypes, and HWE.chisq otherwise.


Changes since version 0.6.4

- Added 'HWE.exact()', an exact test for Hardy-Wienberg Equilibrium for
  two alleles. Code contributed by David Duffy <davidD@qimr.edu.au>

- Added 'gregorius()', which computes the probability of observing all
  alleles with a given frequency in a sample of a specified size.
